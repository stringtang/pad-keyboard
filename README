This is a project from ijimu linux team. For enhance fvkbd and scim and supply a virtual keyboard for touch feature device like pad.

It is a project to enhance the fvkdb project and scim project. It has been tested on Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 11.10. To trigger it, press ctrl + space, and the pad-keyboard would remember when and where to auto-popup. You could also call it by some third party program. Any advice and bugs report would be welcomed.

As an open source project, it is LGPL license, which almost means that do whatever you would like to do with it.

Happy to hack :)
